# Outer Wilds Mod Manager

## Development setup

* Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for `npm`);
* Clone the repo and `cd` to it;
* Install dependencies with `npm install`;
* Start development app `npm run start`;
* Wait a few seconds for the app to draw;
* Changes to components should automatically update the app.

## Building for production
